# Tweet sentiment analyzer

Retrieve latest English-language tweets of public figures in the last 30 days and analyze sentiment. Sort by number of quotes, retweets, or recency (default). 

This app uses [Twitter API v.2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) and a pretrained TensorFlow model. Requests are routed via a server so as to protect tokens/keys/secrets.

**Tech used**: Node, Express, vaguely MVC architecture (but not quite), and node-fetch for http reqs from server (yep, not axios). Front end built with React.

(I forgot I was going to try using a CSS framework/component library here.)

## Run

Not yet deployed, so you will need to set up a project and app on the Twitter Developer Platform and add a **bearer token** as an environment variable for authorization.

Start the server in one terminal:

```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Start the web app in a second terminal:

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Optimizations

It's interesting what gets categorized as positive - the starting thresholds probably need some tweaking (or better yet, eventually changing/training the model, which was based off...IMDB reviews and probably are missing quite a few salient keywords).

**Comparative cheer** (working title)
_draft_: Allow users to save the set of tweets and username to an array that then visualizes sentiment of up to ?? users' tweets across same time period. (Levers could come to include same user, different timeframe, or longer timeframes, etc.)
- Visualization library TBD. Current view is scatter plot of sentiment score (0 negative - 1 positive) vs. date (last 30 days).
- unique color matched to each username.
- likely involving object consisting of { username: 'twitter handle', tweets: scoredData } where scoredData is the array currently rendered of the retrieved tweets.
- need to filter out the pure RTs (indicated by text opener "RT")
- 100% client side ops, no persisting data, for simplicity
- UI: button to "save" user and data into the array
- separate page appears? or just component within same overall? 
  - maybe visualization module when enabled will hide the tweet list
  - Using react router might end up simpler after all: 
     - common to all: header with search term entry
     - component: Nothing to show, conditional based on username
     - component: Full tweet list of active /last searched username, can be cleared*
     - component: visualization of sentiment vs. last 30 days of the saved users
 *current draft approach does not allow removal of any users added for comparison. 
 - UI could/should include a list of the usernames included and in their assigned color code
 - UI should allow for removal of particular username (executed with splice)
 - this is a bit similar to the "compare school rankings" type function
 
Nice to haves
- visual neutral threshold line indicator as well
- tooltip on hover over data point, providing the tweet text; aria-label? of content on click of the data point

Other:
- Compare sentiment vs. engagement (e.g., for a particular figure, over time, is there correlation between what sentiment their tweets are encoded as and engagement rate, and if so, does that person respond by adapting how they frame their tweets accordingly?)
  - Rather arbitrarily, I've decided retweets and quotes are higher-effort engagement, though they could be done for oppositional purposes (mockery, evidence of contrary opinion, etc.)
  - Of course, this also assumes they tweet about relevant topics generally and are eyeballed by people already concerned with such topics (a pleasant "Happy holiday" or "On this day" is not nearly as relevant to 100% audience/followers as a note on a broader political situation, or similarly, a local holiday remark might drive greater interest and engagement from local audience that could overshadow decreased interest abroad... etc.)
- Update model/thresholds... A more govt/politics/international baseline model? Most resources along these lines will be in Python, so another incentive to keep learning.

## Progress

- [x] Successful Postman test of API (Twitter API v2), need to set up server.
- [x] Make successful server-side req to Twitter API (Postman -> server -> API). A long struggle later, it turns out the env vars were not actually being found/recognized server-side. Trimmed dependencies back down and imported dotenv for the main controller instead.
- Brief digression into hosting solution/search. Fly.io did not deploy properly (something to do with husky in the errors)?
- [x] Fix some formatting/width styling wonkiness.
- [x] Finish sentiment analysis piece.
  - Fix CORS issue with SA temp: This disappeared just as suddenly as it occurred.
  - Rewrite for text array and passing tweets array.
- [x] Fix sorting (currently a cheap workaround). 
- [x] Handle user search error: user not found or suspended. 
- [x] Format analysis outputs.
- [ ] Figure out deployment.
- [ ] Make analysis output more visual.

## Setup notes for development

1. npm install your: prettier pretty-quick husky
2. husky: [you are likely on npm version > 7](https://dev.to/maithanhdanh/configuration-for-husky-pre-commit-1fo5)
3. pretty-quick: unlike what the docs say, you need `npx` in the pre-commit hook for it to run properly using husky: `npx pretty-quick --staged`
4. Remember to set up authorization for set of searches (to override) or individually under "auth" even if you have a saved environment selected.

**Observations**

- [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/tree/2.x#readme) for ...server-side HTTP reqs - but turns out this can [only be done with import](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69081410/error-err-require-esm-require-of-es-module-not-supported) (everything must then be updated to import.. syntax)... so I am discovering why folks like axios so much. Remember the file extension must also be included (".js" in this case) and VS Code's helpful suggestions keep leaving it out (leading to errors).
- TensorFlow: evidently "TypeError: forwardFunc is not a function" indicates some version incompatibility between model APIs and the core tf code.
- ["Platform node has already been set. Overwriting the platform withâ€¦cpu backend was already registered"](https://discuss.tensorflow.org/t/platform-node-has-already-been-set-overwriting-the-platform-with-cpu-backend-was-already-registered/4978)
- Tinkering too long = CORS problems start up again? ....
- Would be good to finish learning Python!
